        <li>2 Zucchini</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
        <li>2 italian-styled chicken sausage</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of crushed red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>half sweet chopped onion</li>
        <li>3 chopped garlic cloves</li>
        <li>14.5 ounce of whole peeled chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>half cup of dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>quarter cup of grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of freshly chopped basil</li>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut a lengthwise 3/4-inch thick slice from each zucchini. Retain the lengthwise slices. With a spoon, scoop out the flesh, leaving a shell intact all around the zucchini. Discard or save the flesh for another use. Chop up the retained lengthwise slices of zucchini.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the chicken sausage, breaking the meat up as it cooks, until the sausage has begun to brown, about 8 minutes. Sprinkle in the crushed red pepper flakes, and season with salt and black pepper. Stir in the chopped zucchini, onion, and garlic, and cook until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Scrape the sausage mixture into a bowl, and stir in the tomatoes, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and basil until the stuffing is thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Lightly stuff the zucchini boats with the stuffing, place the zucchini into a baking dish, and bake until thoroughly heated through and beginning to brown on top, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
